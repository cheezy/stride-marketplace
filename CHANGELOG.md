# Changelog

All notable changes to the Stride marketplace pin set will be documented in this file.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — Bumped the `stride` plugin pin from `1.14.1` to `1.15.0` so `/plugin update stride@stride-marketplace` picks up the G156/W758 Option D semantic for `capture_changed_files()` (snapshot reflects the agent's working state at completion time, including uncommitted tracked edits and untracked new files) AND the inline-cat fix in the canonical SKILL.md example (the snapshot read now happens INSIDE the curl invocation via `jq --argjson cf`, so the PreToolUse-on-complete hook has finished writing the file before the read). Marketplace `metadata.version` minor-bumped from `1.27.1` to `1.28.0` to match the broadened plugin semantic. Stride plugin `description` field extended with a `v1.15.0+:` clause describing the new working-tree capture and the inline pattern; v1.14.0+ / v1.14.1+ / v1.13.0+ feature descriptions preserved.

### Source

Stride plugin release: https://github.com/cheezy/stride/releases/tag/v1.15.0 — minor release for G156/W758. The plugin's hook capture broadens (committed + staged + modified-uncommitted + untracked-new all in one snapshot), the canonical SKILL.md example switches to the inline cat pattern, and the kanban-repo `docs/diff-contract.md` Encoding section was updated in lockstep with the working-tree-relative semantic. Wire shape is unchanged; legacy payloads continue to validate.

## [1.27.1] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — Bumped the `stride` plugin pin from `1.14.0` to `1.14.1` so `/plugin update stride@stride-marketplace` picks up the W748 documentation surfacing edits (canonical API Request Format example body now includes `changed_files`; pre-completion verification checklist now contains the "Did you embed `.stride-changed-files.json` into the payload as `changed_files`?" item). Marketplace `metadata.version` patch-bumped from `1.27.0` to `1.27.1` to match. Stride plugin `description` field extended with a `v1.14.1+:` clause noting the surfacing edits; v1.14.0+ feature description preserved.

### Source

Stride plugin release: https://github.com/cheezy/stride/releases/tag/v1.14.1 — patch release for W748 (SKILL.md surfacing edits). No functional change in the plugin; pure documentation update so installed plugins prompt for `changed_files` during normal payload assembly.
